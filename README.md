# 4 DoF Robot 3D Printer

This project is a 3D printed 4 Degree of Freedom (4 DoF) robot arm, inspired by the SCARA robot design from [howtomechatronics.com](https://howtomechatronics.com/projects/scara-robot-how-to-build-your-own-arduino-based-robot/). The robot arm is powered by Arduino and Raspberry Pi, with the software implementation developed by me.

## Design Source

The design of the robot arm is based on the SCARA robot project available at [howtomechatronics.com](https://howtomechatronics.com/projects/scara-robot-how-to-build-your-own-arduino-based-robot/). This comprehensive resource provides detailed instructions, step-by-step guides, and necessary code snippets to build your own SCARA robot. Refer to the website for complete design details and implementation guidelines.

## Hardware Requirements

To replicate this project, the following hardware components are required:

- Arduino board (compatible with the Arduino IDE)
- Raspberry Pi board
- Stepper motors
- Motor drivers
- Mechanical parts (arms, joints, end effector, etc.)
- Power supply
- Other miscellaneous components as per the design specifications

## Software Implementation

The software implementation of the 4 DoF Robot 3D Printer is done by me, utilizing the Arduino IDE for programming the Arduino board and integrating it with the Raspberry Pi for communication and control. The codebase includes firmware for the Arduino board, control algorithms, and any necessary software components to enable precise and coordinated movements of the robot arm.

## Installation and Usage

This section will be added later.
